# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Portfolio Optimization

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A program that allows a user to get an idea of how their portfolio is performing
by comparing it to portfolios that lie along the efficient frontier.


## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The program will take in the names of crypto assets and will output millions of
simulated portfolios, the user can then view different portfolios that lie on the
efficient frontier through an interactive plot.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

I plan on combining the project with my applied data science course. My other project is about analyzing
cryptocurrencies and determining if they are considered a good investment. 1051s project will be a portion of my total analysis
if completed. 
## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I at least want to get the data imported into python as well as cleaned and ready for analysis.
### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

 If I can complete the monte carlo simulation that would be better 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome will be if I complete the project, there are no errors and runs as expected

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

My next steps will be to create a definitive outline that includes more than the three sections I have so far.
1. Importing and cleaning the data to get it ready for analysis

2. Writing the simulation part of the code

4. Visualization

Some new skills I will learn is:

a. How to research for a programming project

b. Getting more familiar with popular python packages

c. Incorporating statistics and mathematics into programming
