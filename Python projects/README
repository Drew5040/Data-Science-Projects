INTRODUCTION

Hello everyone, my name is Andrew O'Drain. Today I am going to demonstrate my final project for CIS 1051: Introduction to Problem solving and programming in Python.
I am a senior and will be graduating this fall  with a B.S in Science in Statistical Science and Data Analytics. The title of the project is “Using Modern Portfolio 
Theory and Monte Carlo Simulation for Portfolio Optimization”. For those of you who do not already know what portfolio optimization is, 
it is the process of  allocating the total sum of an initial investment to a portfolio (let’s say $1000 USD) 
such that volatility (or, standard deviation) is minimized, while expected return and Sharpe ratio is maximized.
