This presentation is derived from a business communications proposal I was tasked with creating while a student.
The proposal was directed at my employer at the time, Community College of Philadephia.
I proposed that the IT department of Community College of Philadelphia implement a tutor matching algorithm.
The algorithm would match students and tutors based on certain metrics.
Please note, this was not a real proposal and was only a class project.

I have also have included the Word document that the proposal is based on.

Thank you & Enjoy!
